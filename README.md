# Yield-Predictions-for-German-Offshore-Tenders-2024
Estimating the potential long-term yield and its distribution over the turbines for the areas N-9.1/N-9.2/N-9.3 northen of Germany using various python packages and methods. This includes yield, internal wake losses and external wake losses.

## Hint: 
- Wind Direction needs to be better corrected
- Code needs to be runs sequencly (except for histograms as it calls a variable defined at the beginning of Task 3)
- For the plotting of the models, nc files are being called which would be saved automatically while running the models
